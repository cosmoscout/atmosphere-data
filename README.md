# Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering Data

This repository is used as a submodule in the [csp-atmospheres](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/tree/main/plugins/csp-atmospheres) of CosmoScout VR.
It contains precomputed scattering data for the Bruneton atmosphere model.
The data is stored in a separate repository to keep the size of the main repository small.

Read the [documentation](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/blob/main/plugins/csp-atmospheres/README.md) of the atmosphere plugin for more information on how this data is created and used.
